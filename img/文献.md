数据挖掘（Data Mining）

NO.1：
In the current era of big data, the mining and analysis of massive data is particularly important. Data mining technology has been widely applied in the fields of media, finance, medical care, transportation and e-commerce.However, the complexity and diversity of big data and the particularity of the application of data mining technology in various industries have also put forward new theoretical and technical challenges in the field of data mining.

NO.2：
The era of big data for the data mining technology has brought more opportunities and problems, such as the big data content for more efficient data mining algorithm and the accumulation of large data more quickness requirement of real-time data mining algorithms, the complexity of the large data diversity requires more flexible data mining algorithm, the universality of big data in all walks of life to the particularity in the field of data mining algorithm, etc.This also presents a new demand for data mining.
